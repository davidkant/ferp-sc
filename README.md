###SuperCollider tools for Real-Time Acoustic Environmental Audio Analysis 

This repository is a workspace for EnviroSoundLab directed by David Dunn. These are a few tools for analyzing acoustic environmental monitoring data captured at the FERP.

###Includes
* __~differenceEngine__ measures instantaneous acoustic difference by taking cosine distance on frame to frame audio feature vectors
* __~entropyEngine__ implements information dynamical measures of entropy
* +__plots__ for viewing
